# Beauids

This was a follow-up I made when I was programming some boids models.  
The program shows the connections between boids rather than the boids themselves, which leads to some rather pretty effects.

### Usage

There are 7 sliders shown like this:

Here is what each of them does in order:

1. Number of species (1-6)
2. Cohesion (0-0.1)
3. Alignment (0-0.1)
4. Separation (0-300)
5. Vision radius (0-100)
6. Speed (time interval) (0-1)
7. Boundaries for the boids (0-400)
